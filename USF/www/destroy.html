            <p>Your previous USF Session has been Terminated; any data that was not actively stored will be lost (Session monitoring and progress data is stored automatically). This means that you will need start a New Session. If you are an &quot;Admin&quot; User you could reconnect to your old Session but it cannot be guaranteed that all unsaved data will be restored.</p>
